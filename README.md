# Samuel Wagner
**EE @ Texas A&M** · Embedded systems, electronics design, and system integration.  
Hands-on projects: ESP32/servo control, KiCad PCB, robotics, and test/validation.

## Completed Projects
Hands-on Arduino projects developed to explore fundamental electronics and embedded concepts:
- **Password Detector (LCD Display)** – user input validation and display interface
- **Variable-Speed DC Motor Control** – PWM speed control using potentiometer and H-bridge driver
- **Spinning 3D Cube (OLED Display)** – 3D graphics rendered through coordinate transformations
- **Digital Dice Game (Dot Matrix Display)** – random number generation with visual output

## Work-in-Progress (WIP) Projects
- **Security Door Lock (Arduino Microcontroller)**  
  Developing an RFID and keypad-based access control system. Coding was near completion, but a faulty RFID module halted prototype assembly. Testing will resume once replacement parts arrive.

- **Desktop Robotic Arm (ESP32-S3)**  
  Long-term project exploring embedded control, servo coordination, and 3D-printed mechanical design.  
  Currently refining component selection and CAD geometry while saving for tool and material purchases.  
  Targeting a working prototype and motion validation milestone by the end of **2025**.

## Skills
Embedded C/C++, schematic capture & PCB layout (KiCad learning), LTspice/MATLAB, oscilloscope/logic analyzer, CAD (Inventor/SolidWorks).
